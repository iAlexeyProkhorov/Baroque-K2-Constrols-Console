# K2 Java Script Console
HiðŸ‘‹!
Today I want to represent you my first public K2 custom control. It's allows you to use standard browser's console for you K2 applications debugging.

# Foreword
Once I've an expirience with Nintex K2 BPM platform and need to debug some smartforms. After few days I understand one thing: "I really hate popup message boxes for debugging".
If I need to get some value in special moment, I need to add a message box in rule or add visible data label. It's bad because:
* After debug you should make data label invisible or disable message box;
* If you forget to do previous point, everybody see's it. It's not critical, but nobody gives praise for this;
* Popup messages requires your participation (need to click something everytime);

# About
This small custom control allows you to use [Java Script standard console](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_console.asp) for debugging K2 smartforms. Control supports
almost all standard console methods except: **assert** and **table**. I will try to add them in next version. So [here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_console.asp) you can read all about console methods.

## Supported methods:
* [Clear](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_console_clear.asp);
